### HW1:
`Rmarkdown`
- Perform variable selection according to C_p, BIC, and adjusted R^2 using forward stepwise selection and backward stepwise selection method
- Fit Lasso model and use cross-validation method to select the optimal penalty coefficient 
- Fit a linear model, a ridge regression model and a Lasso model to predict the number of college applications 
- Report test error and R^2 to compare accuracy


### HW2:
`Rmarkdown`
> Project 1
- Perform Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression on `Auto` dataset to predict whether a given car gets high or low gas mileage. Compare the results from the three methods with the confusion matrix.
> Project 2
- Fit Cubic splines and natural cubic splines on Covid-19 dataset to analysis the increase of comfirmed cases in California, Washington and New York
- Fit Smoothing Spline to predict the number of confirmed cases in California in 30 days


### HW3:
`Rmarkdown`
> Project 1
- Fit SVMs with linear, radial and polynomial basis kernels to classify and predict whether a given car gets high or low gas mileage
> Project 2
- K-Means Clustering, PCA and MDS

### HW4: 
`python`
- Neural network with one hidden layer
